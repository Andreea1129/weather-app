# weather-app
For this app, I interacted with the backend: the weather data is taken from a free API, OpenWeather.
The project structure is organized in modules: for each important section of the application there is a dedicated JS file or folder, which makes the code easy to understand.

# Features:
- The user can select the location for which they want to see the weather information.
- When the user clicks the "Choose another city" button, the city image is updated, the current city name changes, and both, the current weather section and the 5-day forecast section are reloaded.
- After selecting a city, the user can directly access the "current weather" and "5-day forecast" links to jump quickly to those sections on page.
- The application includes a scrollToTop button, which can be used to go back to the top of the page.
- The weather app is responsive, so it can be used both on desktop or mobile.
